initial starting point (x(E|W), y(N|S), z(above|below))


the direction it is facing (N, S, E, W, Up, Down)

    1.Move the spacecraft forward/backward (f, b): The spacecraft moves one step forward or backward based on its current direction.
    2.Turn the spacecraft left/right (l, r): The spacecraft rotates 90 degrees to the left or right, changing its facing direction.
    3.Turn the spacecraft up/down (u, d): The spacecraft changes its angle, rotating upwards or downwards.


Example
Given the starting point (0, 0, 0) following (x, y, z) and initial direction N, the following commands should result in the indicated final 
position and direction:

Commands: [“f”, “r”, “u”, “b”, “l”]

Starting Position: (0, 0, 0)

Initial Direction: N

“f” - (0, 1, 0) - N
“r” - (0, 1, 0) - E
“u” - (0, 1, 0) - U
“b” - (0, 1, -1) - U
“l” - (0, 1, -1) - W
Final Position: (0, 1, -1)

Final Direction: W

Observations:
left-right and up-down =>stay at same coordinate
forward-backward => changes coordinate as per its current direction

As spacecraft cannot move/rotate diagonally => I have taken 90degree rotation for upward/downward
